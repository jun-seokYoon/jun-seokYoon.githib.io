# Welcome

**Hello world**
This is my first blog post.
I'm studing Coding and Chemistry in HUFS.
My goal is to develop new materials such as photocatalysts by applying Machine learning to chemistry
to develop biosensors or new types of batteries.
For this, I'm now studying coding using Python and
studying as a research student in the Nano-Bio Electrochemistry Lab in HUFS.
