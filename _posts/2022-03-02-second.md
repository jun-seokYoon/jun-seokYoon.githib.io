# 

This practice is belong to 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWiCuklohdY'

print("hello world")

# 1. str, int and float

1 = int

"1" = str 

"Hello world" = str

0.1 = float 

# 2. How to know the type of data -> use "type()" function  

ex) 

print(type(1)) 

=> int


# 3. How to assign a variable

Variable is memory space that save data 


ex) 

variable1 = "junseok"

print(variable1)

=> junseok

print(type(variable1))

=> str


ex2)

animal = "cat"

name = "nabi"

age = 2

hobby = "walking"

print(name + "is" + str(age) + "years old," + "and her hobby is" + hobby )

=> nabi is 2 years old, and her hobby is walking

;variable 'age' is int, we need to change int to str, so we use str() to shange type of variable 'age'

;Why We Change int to str???


# 4. arithmetic operator (연산자)

 + : 덧셈

- : 뺄셈

/ : 나눗셈

//: 나누기 이후 몫의 정수부분만

% : 나눗셈 이후 나머지

* : 곱셈

**: 제곱

<>= : 비교

== : 앞과 뒤가 같은가? T/F

!= : 앞과 뒤가 다른가? T/F
 
 
# 5. and, or, not, True / False
 
 and : union set
 
 or : intersection set
 
 not : complement set
 
 True / False : Judging whether an formula or string is right or wrong
